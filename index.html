    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</strong>

        My academic curriculum includes programming, database management,
        and web development fundamentals.
        I completed my secondary education from <strong>MP Board</strong>,
        which helped me build a strong foundation in mathematics
        and computer concepts.
        My education has improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

    <!-- Internship -->
    <h3 clas =" Intern">Internship</h3>
    <p>
        I completed a <strong>Web Development Internship at YuvaIntern</strong>,
        where I gained practical experience in frontend development.
        During the internship, I worked on converting wireframes into
        static web pages using HTML and CSS.
        I learned to design responsive layouts using media queries.
        I also implemented JavaScript features to add interactivity.
        This internship helped me understand real-world project structure.
        I improved my debugging and clean coding practices.
        Overall, the internship increased my confidence in building web projects independently.
    </p> <br><br>

    <!-- Project -->
    <h3 class=" project">Project</h3>
    <p>
        I developed a <strong>Personal Portfolio Website</strong> as my first project
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        The website contains sections like Home, About, Summary, and Resume.
        JavaScript was used for typing text animation and menu toggle functionality.
        The project is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
        This project helped me apply my learning into a real-world application.
